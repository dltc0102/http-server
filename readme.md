# Create a HTTP Server in C
This program is for learning C better.

my goals:
1. create a port
2. implement GET and POST
2.5. make an arbitrary function that returns body and computes content length
3. make sure I can access GET and POST through the browser
4. add non-static handlers
5. add multithreading
6. add routing

*. make sure code has good error handling and memory allocation
